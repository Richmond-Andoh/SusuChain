# SusuChain

A mobile-first decentralized micro-savings and emergency fund DApp for African informal workers.

## Overview

SusuChain allows users to save tiny amounts securely on Scroll blockchain and withdraw funds only during emergencies or when savings goals are reached. This removes temptation, middlemen, and fraud common in traditional susu systems.
